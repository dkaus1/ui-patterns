Moixin Pattern

What it is - A mixin is an object that we can use in order to add reusable functionality to another object or class, without using inheritance. We can't use mixins on their own: their sole purpose is to add functionality to objects or classes without inheritance.

When to use it - Mixins allow us to easily add functionality to objects without inheritance by injecting functionality into an object's prototype. Modifying an object's prototype is seen as bad practice, as it can lead to prototype pollution and a level of uncertainty regarding the origin of our functions.

Use cases: Adding functionality without using inheritance
