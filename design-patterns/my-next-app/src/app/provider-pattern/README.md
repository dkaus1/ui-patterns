Provider Pattern

What it is - Provider pattern is a design approach used to manage and pass data down the component tree without the need to explicitly pass props through every intermediate component. 

When to use it - Use the Provider pattern when you have data or state that multiple components need to access and share without explicitly passing it through each component as props.

Use cases: Theme Switching, User Authentication, Language Preferences, Notifications
