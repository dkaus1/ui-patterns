Module Pattern

What it is - A Module is a file containing JavaScript code, with some difference in behavior compared to a normal script.

When to use it - With the module pattern, we can encapsulate parts of our code that should not be publicly exposed. This prevents accidental name collision and global scope pollution, which makes working with multiple dependencies and namespaces less risky. 

Use cases: Imports
